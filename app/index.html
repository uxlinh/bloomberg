                For the past few decades there’s been a rough consensus about how to run a modern capitalist economy.
                Trade should be free. The gold standard is archaic. Antitrust should protect consumers rather than
                punish bigness. Tax rates should be (modestly) higher for the rich. Government should run big deficits
                during recessions to support growth but get frugal during good times to reduce debt. Republicans and
                Democrats didn’t agree on everything, but the economists in their respective brain trusts shared a
                general understanding of how to build prosperity.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                That centrist consensus is losing its power. Republicans are being drawn toward the protectionism of
                President Trump, Democrats toward the socialism of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the freshman
                congresswoman from New York City. Trust in the establishment is low, leaving people open to alternatives
                “whether they come from the Left or the Right,” says Patrick Egan, a New York University political
                scientist. “People are open to change and new ideas in a pretty substantial way.”

                This dissatisfaction with the status quo seems surprising on one level. Unemployment is low. If this
                U.S. economic expansion lasts past its 10th anniversary in June, it will be the longest since records
                began in 1854. But much of the prosperity has accrued to those at the top. Meanwhile, China is
                overtaking the U.S., and climate change threatens the planet.

            <p class="paragraph">
                That makes this a good time to look at some of the ideas for fixing American capitalism that will be
                debated in the 2020 presidential campaign. Here, we identify potential remedies, name their advocates,
                and explain the schools of thought from which they emerge. We don’t pick favorites—that’s for you to do.

                        Many of the U.S.’s biggest economic ills—rising inequality, stagnant wages, low productivity
                        growth—stem in large measure from corporate consolidation and monopoly power run amok. That’s
                        the message from a new breed of policy wonk urging a return to the trustbusting days of the
                        early 20th century.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The movement—labeled the New Brandeis School by its proponents and derided as Hipster Antitrust
                        by its critics—is looking to ditch the Chicago School approach that’s dominated antitrust
                        enforcement since the late 1970s. The Chicago School hews to what’s known as the
                        consumer-welfare standard, which finds mergers anticompetitive only if they raise prices.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The new model takes its inspiration from Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, who emphasized
                        the need to restrain big companies and the concentration of economic power. Lina Khan helped
                        galvanize the movement with a 2017 paper she wrote as a law student at Yale that made the case
                        that Amazon.com Inc. is a threat to competition, even though it's lowered some prices for
                        consumers.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The ideas in Khan’s paper aligned with those of economists and lawyers, such as Tim Wu, a
                        Columbia Law School professor, who’ve been arguing that the current antitrust framework is
                        ill-equipped to deal with today’s technology titans. Among their recommendations is preventing
                        tech platforms from vertically integrating into different lines of business, where they can
                        potentially favor their own services and harm rivals. In this view, Facebook shouldn’t be
                        allowed to own Instagram.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Defenders of the current framework say the New Brandeis School is nothing more than a big-is-bad
                        ethos that would punish companies for being successful and popular with consumers. Yet it’s hard
                        to ignore the growing body of research documenting the relationship between rising corporate
                        consolidation and worrying economic trends, including a drop in the number of startups and tepid
                        wage growth.

                        One sign of the movement’s increasing influence is that Joseph Simons, chairman of the Federal
                        Trade Commission, one of the country’s two antitrust watchdogs, has organized hearings on the
                        new enforcement approach. Also, Democratic presidential candidates such as Senator Elizabeth
                        Warren are making antitrust enforcement a central part of their campaigns. —David McLaughlin

                        The broad contours of the Republican plan to optimize capitalism don’t look much different today
                        than they did in the 1980s. The supply-side pitch is that reducing taxes on companies and
                        top-earning individuals, curtailing spending on welfare programs, and slashing regulation spurs
                        business investment. This leads to faster economic growth that benefits all Americans. Even the
                        cast of characters is familiar. President Trump’s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, promoted a
                        similar agenda as an official in the Reagan White House.

                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The first piece of the formula is already in place: A Republican-controlled Congress approved
                        tax cuts at the end of Trump’s first year in office. (The jury is still out on whether those
                        have permanently lifted the U.S. economy onto a higher growth track, as proponents argued.) The
                        other piece—reducing future obligations of major entitlement programs—will be difficult to pull
                        off now that Democrats control the House of Representatives and the political winds blow in the
                        direction of a more relaxed attitude toward government budget deficits.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Still, it’s seen as a key ingredient. In a 2017 white paper, John Cogan, Glenn Hubbard, John
                        Taylor, and Kevin Warsh—all pillars of Republican establishment economic policy circles—argued
                        that “without significant spending restraint, even with positive effects on economic growth, the
                        tax rate reductions would likely be limited and temporary, limiting their economic benefits.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The contention is that spending on welfare eventually will account for an ever-growing share of
                        the economy, “crowding out” private-sector investment and weighing on growth. This view is still
                        widely held among Washington policymakers. At a Jan. 30 press conference, Federal Reserve
                        Chairman Jerome Powell said, “It is a long-known fact that the U.S. federal government budget is
                        on an unsustainable path,” citing rising health-care costs and an aging population.

                        Conservative economists will likely have a difficult time rallying voters to their cause in 2020
                        because of the public perception that the orthodox prescription is partly to blame for widening
                        inequality. It’s a fact that wealth disparities in the U.S. have been rising ever since the
                        early 1980s—the last time Republicans presided over a sea change in the economic agenda.

                        The search for better ways to distribute the fruits of American capitalism has some looking to
                        Europe for inspiration. Germany offers a model of how corporate governance could be revamped to
                        give American workers a bigger say over what happens to company profits. A law that took effect
                        in 1976 formalized what had been common practice at many German companies as far back as the
                        1920s. It dictates that in a corporation with more than 500 employees, a third of supervisory
                        board seats must be filled by directors elected by workers, a share that rises to one-half for
                        companies with more than 2,000 employees.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The German system, known as co-determination, allows employees to have a say in working
                        conditions, such as contractual terms and pay. It also gives them a voice in how profits are
                        deployed—say, for a new research and development center vs. more dividends for shareholders.
                        Some researchers say co-determination has helped spur productivity and innovation at German
                        companies.

                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        At the root of co-determination is the idea that companies should balance the interests of their
                        various stakeholders, a group that includes equity owners but also workers, customers, and even
                        local communities. That was also the ideal in the U.S. until the early 1980s, when under the
                        influence of economist Milton Friedman it was supplanted by the belief that corporate managers’
                        sole responsibility is to maximize returns for shareholders. That single-minded devotion to
                        stockholders has been cited as a factor in the stagnation of U.S. wages.

                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        In August, Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren unveiled her Accountable Capitalism
                        Act, which draws from the German experience. The plan would allocate a minimum of 40 percent of
                        a company’s board seats to directors representing workers. The requirement would apply to
                        U.S.-domiciled corporations with more than $1 billion in annual revenue. Warren’s proposal is
                        designed as a corrective to a trend that has been drawing increased scrutiny of late: Publicly
                        traded companies in the U.S. have been devoting more and more of their profits to share buybacks
                        and dividends. Given that less than half of U.S. households own stocks, the chances that workers
                        will benefit when their employer succeeds improve markedly when profits are plowed back into the
                        company. —Carolynn Look

                        Any ambitious government-led project to reshape the U.S. economy usually runs into the same
                        objection: We can’t afford it. One school of economic thought says that’s all wrong.

                        Modern Monetary Theory, a once-fringe set of ideas now getting some mainstream attention, says
                        governments borrowing in their own currency have more room to spend than they think. The U.S.,
                        for example, can run deficits without having to worry about going bust, because it creates the
                        dollars in the first place. The real constraint only kicks in when there’s too much spending
                        relative to a limited supply of goods and services—in other words, when inflation spikes. And
                        there’s been little sign of that in America for decades.

                        MMTers argue that their system isn’t so radical; it’s the way things already work, at least some
                        of the time. Presidents, including the current one, haven’t balked at measures to boost the
                        military or cut taxes, even when the resulting deficits run into the hundreds of billions. And
                        emergencies, such as the 2008 financial meltdown, typically push concerns about balanced budgets
                        deep into the background.
                        Now there’s a different sort of emergency on the horizon: climate change. Since the threat is
                        arguably greater than economic depression or even war, it requires action on a suitably vast
                        scale, argue Democrats who’ve picked up on the issue.

                        And MMT offers a key to unlock the financing. That’s why freshman Representative Alexandria
                        Ocasio-Cortez, one of the first U.S. politicians to talk publicly about MMT, is also at the
                        forefront of the drive for a Green New Deal. The maximal version of that program includes
                        shifting the U.S. to 100 percent renewable energy within 10 years. If that wasn’t ambitious
                        enough, the plan also calls for the government to guarantee a job for everyone who wants one—an
                        MMT favorite that’s also a throwback to Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal.

                        “Clearly, the environment matters more than entries on balance sheets,” says Randall Wray, a
                        senior scholar at the Levy Economics Institute of Bard College and one of MMT’s most prominent
                        proponents. “The environmental thing is real. It’s not financial.”

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        MMT’s detractors say government spending on that scale could trigger the kind of inflation that
                        would wreck the whole economy. America’s national debt has already ballooned since the Great
                        Recession, they warn, and adding more will erode the country’s creditworthiness and undermine
                        the dollar’s role in global finance.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        While those warnings are still frequently heard, there are signs that they’re losing their
                        impact as the debate leans left. Several renowned economists who aren’t MMTers have recently
                        tried to downplay the risks attached to deficits and debt. They include Olivier Blanchard,
                        former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, and Obama administration heavyweights
                        Larry Summers and Jason Furman. Bank of England chief Mark Carney has made the case that action
                        on climate change represents an economic opportunity, not a burden.

                        Ocasio-Cortez didn’t manage to garner enough Democratic support for her first attempt at actual
                        legislation, a proposal to set up a Green New Deal committee. But there’s broad sympathy for the
                        idea in principle, including among several of the party’s presidential candidates, and many of
                        them have also endorsed a jobs guarantee. —Katia Dmitrieva

                        Amazon.com Inc. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos wishes there were a trillion
                        human beings in the solar system. With room for that many people, there would be “a thousand
                        Einsteins and a thousand Mozarts,” he told the Economic Club of Washington, D.C., in September.
                        The world’s richest man is funneling $1 billion or more a year into a company, Blue Origin, that
                        he hopes will help make extraterrestrial settlement a reality, creating places to live for all
                        those Einsteins and Mozarts.

                        Bezos and others argue that innovation is the essential ingredient in human betterment. They
                        have a point. Life would be pretty awful without the advances made by past generations, such as
                        indoor plumbing, vaccines, refrigeration, and telephones. Bezos even asserts that freedom
                        itself, not just material well-being, depends on technological progress: “I don’t even think
                        stasis is compatible with liberty,” he told the Washington audience.

                        In the view of the tech-to-the-rescue crowd, innovation can solve just about every problem
                        humanity faces. Global warming can be fixed with better electric cars, solar cells, wind
                        turbines, and batteries. Income inequality can be solved by educating or retraining workers for
                        the high-tech jobs of the future.

                        The Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, a Washington think tank founded in 2006 to
                        propagate this philosophy, argues that using antitrust law to break up or discipline the big
                        technology companies can backfire, discouraging innovation and harming consumers. Robert
                        Atkinson, president and founder of the ITIF, co-wrote a 2018 book with Michael Lind called Big

                        supporting research and development. But the movement is split on trade. The nationalists want
                        to keep the U.S. in the tech vanguard and are willing to resort to tariffs and subsidies to
                        preserve its dominance. The globalists, including some heads of multinational companies that
                        earn lots of their profits abroad, are happy to see other countries advance technologically,
                        figuring that the benefits of breakthroughs—say, a cure for cancer—will be shared by all of
                        humanity regardless of their origin.

                        If there’s one thing most economists around the world today can agree on, it’s that tariffs are
                        bad. Protect one domestic industry with an import tax, and you hurt a swath of others. Tariffs
                        reduce choices for consumers and push up prices for goods. They stifle competition and deter
                        innovation. And they invite other countries to retaliate, leading to the sort of tit-for-tat
                        behavior that’s left U.S. soybean farmers watching crops once destined for China rot in their
                        fields.

                        The president, of course, disagrees. “I am a Tariff Man,” he proclaimed in a Dec. 4 tweet.
                        Besides Trump, the maligned tariff has a small core of defenders on the fringes of mainstream
                        economics who claim an intellectual history going back to Alexander Hamilton and his “Report on
                        Manufactures” to justify the value of duties. Tariffs, argues Jeff Ferry, chief economist at the
                        Coalition for a Prosperous America (CPA), preserve jobs and help unleash investment.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The Washington-based CPA has close ties to the administration. Its chairman, Dan DiMicco, is a
                        former Nucor Corp. chief executive and was a vocal advocate for the steel tariffs Trump
                        introduced in 2018. He also led the transition team that picked Robert Lighthizer for the job of
                        trade czar.
                        The Trump tariffs have so far hit more than $300 billion in U.S. imports from around the world.
                        And there may be more to come, with the U.S. Department of Commerce now finalizing an
                        investigation into possible auto duties.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The Trump administration and groups such as the CPA that favor greater protectionism say the
                        levies have helped trigger a manufacturing boom that led to the addition of 284,000 jobs in
                        2018, according to official statistics. “If you look at the evidence, tariffs are contributing
                        to the growth of our economy,” wrote Ferry in a column published on the CPA’s website in
                        December.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Many dispute those numbers. They also argue the tariffs will lead to longer-term economic harm
                        by reducing the attraction of the U.S. as a location for export-oriented plants. Volvo Cars, for
                        example, has scrapped plans to expand a South Carolina plant to ship cars to China. General
                        Motors Co., meanwhile, has said the fallout from duties on foreign steel and aluminum have cost
                        it at least $1 billion. But Ferry dismisses any such complaints. “Tariffs are a step in the
                        right direction,” he says. “The evidence is all around us.” —Shawn Donnan

                        Devotees of small government were stirred by candidate Trump’s vow to “drain the swamp” and pull
                        U.S. troops out of foreign quagmires. But President Trump, with his tariffs and deficits, has
                        proved to be “the opposite of a libertarian,” the Libertarian Party declared in March.

                        Austrian economist and libertarian idol Friedrich Hayek. When Ron Paul, America’s
                        highest-profile libertarian, ran for president in 2012, he pushed for the Fed’s abolition and a
                        return to the gold standard. “If you want to restrain government, you restrain the power to
                        create money,” he said. “That’s what gold does.”

                        The Fed can probably rest easy. Americans aren’t exactly clamoring for a return to gold, while
                        hyperinflation and other disasters predicted by libertarians in the easy-money decade since 2008
                        haven’t come to pass.

                        Some libertarian ideas are finding a larger audience. Among them are the call for stripping back
                        zoning rules, because they limit the construction of affordable housing, and their criticism of
                        patents that lock in profits for Big Tech or Pharma and licensing requirements that insulate
                        professionals like doctors from competition. A common theme of such critiques—that the economy
                        is rigged in favor of big and established actors—commands growing support among mainstream
                        economists.

                        And beyond the realms of U.S. policy, the world is evolving in ways that give libertarians hope.
                        Those who deplore the “tyranny” of central banks are rejoicing at the explosion of
                        cryptocurrencies. (The Libertarian Party accepts donations in Bitcoin.) Recreational marijuana
                        use is already legal in 10 states and backed by more than 6 in 10 Americans, according to a poll
